## This project contains:

* Idisposable<br>
IDisposable is an interface that contains a single method, Dispose(), for releasing unmanaged resources, like files, streams, database connections and so on.
This method is implemented explicitly in the code when we need to clean up a disposable object and to release unmanaged resources that this disposable object holds.
